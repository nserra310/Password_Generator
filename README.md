# Password_Generator

Creating a random password generator using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript

-Started by building a basic HTML and tried to structure it similar to the template that was given to reference from. 

-Used bootstrap to create a top nav bar where the title of the website would be displayed.

-Created a container and using rows and columns in bootstrap to layout content area of the password generator and included a text box input and a slider input to gauge the length of the password to be generated.

-Created two buttons called 'generate' and 'copy password'.

-Created variables and functions in JavaScript.

-Used a for loop to run all the capitalized and lower case letters in the alphabet, numbers, and special characters through the loop using Math.floor(Math.random( ).

-Created a conditional so that if the slider is slid all the way to 0 it would reset at 1.

-Created a function that would take the random password that is gererated and copy that password to clipboard.

-Finally created an alert message that would appear once the user clicked the copy to clip board button.
